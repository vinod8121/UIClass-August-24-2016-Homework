1,Operator precedence ?
Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

2.diff b/w == and ===
x==y(equal) compares if the two values are equal
x===y(Strict equal) compares the two values and the type of the variables.
x!=y(unequal) both values are different
x!==y(strict uneual) both are different with different datatypes.

3.null and undefined ?
NULL is a special value meaning "no value". null is a special object because typeof null returns 'object'. 

Undefined means that the variable has not been declared, or has not been given a value.

null === undefined           // false
null == undefined            // true


4.for , while , do-while ?
for - loops through a block of code a number of times

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    code block to be executed
}

while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

while (condition) {
    code block to be executed
}

do/while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

do {
